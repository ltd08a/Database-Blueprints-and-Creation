# Database-Normalization-and-Creation
A project showcasing the development of database blueprints and the SQL to create them.
This project will display competencies in the following areas:
1. Conceptual Models to Physical Schemas: Create conceptual data models and translate them into physical schemas.
2. Create Databases: Create databases utilizing SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) in MySQL environment.
3. Create/Modify Tables and Views: Create and modify tables and views employing SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) in MySQL environment.
4. Create Primary Keys/Foreign Keys and Indexes: Create and modify primary keys (PKs) and foreign keys (FKs) and indexes with SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) in MySQL environment.
5. Populate Tables: Populate tables with insert, update, and delete using DML in the MySQL environment.
6. Create Simple and Complex Queries: Create simple Select-From-Where (SFW) and complex 3+ table join queries with Data Manipulation Language (DML) in MySQL environment.

Part I
Database Normalization
In this part of the project I will take the database from 1st normal form to 2nd normal form, then to 3rd normal form. After that I will create a final physical database model before I work in MySQL to actually create the database.

Part II
Database Creation with MySQL
This section will be used to display the use of SQL in MySQL to create a database.
